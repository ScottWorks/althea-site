To avoid loops in a routing protocol, nodes must be able to tell if they have previously handled a piece of data. Otherwise routing loops can result, where nodes continue to forward the same routing message in a loop indefinitely. Time to live (TTL) is a number that is added to a routing message and decremented each time it is forwarded. This can mitigate routing loops, but it is kind of a bandaid. Also, it leaks information about the source of a routing message. A node with a high TTL can be presumed to be early in the route.

We need someting better. One technique would be to add an array to each routing message. Each node then inserts a random number into the array and remembers the number. When a node then gets the routing message, it checks if it includes a
